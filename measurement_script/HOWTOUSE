Hi,
These scripts are not "so" automatic, we have to prepare a little at the begining in order to run the scripts.
1. Create the VMs that we want to do the test, then get the floating IP of that VM and put it to a .lst file in testdir
2. After having the VMs ready and the list of IP address in the file .lst, we can run the test now:
 + mvmtestrun.sh: Multiple VMs with Single Process Test
 + vm1coretest.sh: Single 1-core VM with Multiple Processes Test
 + vm2coretest.sh: Single 2-core VM with Multiple Processes Test
 + vm4coretest.sh: Single 4-core VM with Multiple Processes Test
 + vm8coretest.sh: Single 8-core VM with Multiple Processes Test
 + vm16coretest.sh: Single 16-core VM with Multiple Processes Test
 + bigfoot16procstest.sh: Single physical host with multiple processes test
The main modifition in this step is the IP addresses of the machine that we will run FIO on.  
3. After the test run, you should have list of directory which contain the FIO output with terse format
4. You can use the script inside directory ReadFIO to read the input and save them in a csv file
