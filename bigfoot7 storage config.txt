sdf:
 - RAID 0 virtual disk based on the physical disk 0
 - adaptive read-ahead
 - write back cache
 - strip element size: 64KB
 - disk cache disabled (default)
 - partitioned, used for boot and OS

sdg: No cache
 - RAID 0 virtual disk based on the physical disk 0
 - no read-ahead
 - write through cache
 - strip element size: 64KB
 - disk cache disabled (default)
 - not partitioned

sdh: like sdf, but biggest strip element size
 - RAID 0 virtual disk based on the physical disk 0
 - adaptive read-ahead
 - write back cache
 - strip element size: 1MB
 - disk cache disabled (default)
 - not partitioned

sdi: like sdf, to do measurements with concurrent accesses
 - RAID 0 virtual disk based on the physical disk 0
 - adaptive read-ahead
 - write back cache
 - strip element size: 64KB
 - disk cache disabled (default)
 - not partitioned

sdj: like sdf, but with disk cache enabled
 - RAID 0 virtual disk based on the physical disk 0
 - adaptive read-ahead
 - write back cache
 - strip element size: 64KB
 - disk cache enabled
 - not partitioned

sda, sdb, sdc, sdd, sde:
 - No RAID
